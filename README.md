### Hi there 👋

  <h2>I'm Florian</h2>

  <h3> Where am I ? </h3>

  - 📍 France / Provins (near Paris)
  - 💻 🌍 Remote from France
  - 🚀 Currently **Founding Engineer** @ [Méthode Aristote](https://methode-aristote.fr/) (part of Cartesia Education group)
  - 🔗 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-bruniaux-43408b83/)

  <h3> 👨🏻‍💻 About Me </h3>

  💼 **11+ years in tech ecosystem** — After a decade in leadership roles (CTO, VP Engineering, Engineering Manager), I've deliberately gone back to being **hands-on as a Founding/Staff Engineer**. Why? To sharpen my technical edge and come back to leadership stronger.

  🤖 **AI-first mindset**: I've fully embraced the AI revolution and use it daily in my workflow. Check out my [Claude Code Ultimate Guide](https://github.com/FlorianBruniaux/claude-code-ultimate-guide) — a comprehensive resource for mastering AI-assisted development.

  **My journey:**
  - 🎓 &nbsp; Computer engineering degree / French Engineer school @[UTT](https://www.utt.fr/)
  - 🎩 **Leadership** : Attract talent & onboard them, scale company processes, build & develop engineering culture, tech & human problem solving, mentor & coach, improve team efficiency & velocity, animate passion through events (meetups, workshops...). Replays of previous meetups : https://bit.ly/3g7VmBh
  - 💻 **Tech** : Fullstack developer, preference for backend (TypeScript / Ruby / Python & SQL databases) & infra (AWS/GCP, serverless, Kubernetes)
  - 🛠 **Product** : Built and maintained several SAAS tools and solutions (B2B, B2C) & cross device (web, mobile) in agile methodology
  - 🕸️ **Domains** : SaaS / E-commerce / Data / B2B & B2C / EdTech / AI
  - 👷 **Roles** : Founding Engineer / CTPO / CTO / VP of Engineering / Engineering Manager / Staff Engineer
  - 🌱 → 🌳 **Company stages** : Early stage & post seed (hands-on CTO, CTPO), post Series A (CTO), scale-up & post buyout (EM, VP Eng), SMEs
  - 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Team size** : from 4 to 150 people, built & scaled several teams from scratch, managed up to 30 tech people
  - 🌐 **Languages** : Fluent in French & English

  Passionate since my youngest age, deeply geek, I solve problems by combining the power of the human mind and the machine. Still learning every day — I like to "go to bed less stupid than the day before!"

  <h3>🛠 Tech Stack</h3>
