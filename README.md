<h3> 👨🏻‍💻 About Me </h3>

Passionate since my youngest age, deeply geek, I have the chance to exercise my passion on a daily basis: solving all types of problems by combining the power of the human mind and the machine thanks to technologies! Still learning and reading books or interacting with people from all walks of life, i’m curious and like to learn and "go to bed less stupid than the day before!"

I apply leadership based on transparency and energy. I unite and protect my teams at all costs by instilling in them the values that are close to my heart: loyalty, ambition and benevolence.

Demanding, I am used to taking ownership of multiple key projects (organizational and technical). Rational and pragmatic, I like to explain with facts and figures while knowing how to trust my intuition.
